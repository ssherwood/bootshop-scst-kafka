# Bootshop: Spring Cloud Stream with Kafka

## Overview

Welcome to the Spring Boot Workshop (aka a "Bootshop") for Spring Cloud Streams with Apache Kafka.

This edition focuses on using the newer functional programming model introduced in SCSt 3.x. This workshop also focuses
on leveraging Apache Kafka as the underlying binder implementation but could be translated to support any number of
available binders.

## Technical Pre-requisites

- A modern OS like Mac or Linux (or using the Windows Subsystem for Linux).
- A modern IDE like IntelliJ or VSCode.
- Familiarity with modern Java 8+.
- Comfortable using the terminal and CLIs.
- Docker is installed.
- [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart) is installed.
- The [kafkacat CLI](https://github.com/edenhill/kafkacat) is installed.
